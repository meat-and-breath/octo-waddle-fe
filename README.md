# octo-waddle

Octo Waddle (a GitHub suggested name) is a simple project the implements a workflow for trading resources. In this case, the resources are specifically player contracts, though I realized a day into this project that they could be any artbitrary thing with some more engineering work. They are players because this toy project was imagined as part of an online system for simulating a sports league. In the grand scheme of things, this piece felt like a good starting point for a toy project.

While I've imagined this running a virtual roller derby league for the last 5+ years, it owes direct inspiration to the [Transcontinental Baseball League](https://www.tblhome.com), who have been playing their tweaked version of [ABPA Baseball](http://apbagames.com/apbabaseball) for over 40 years. Thank you to [Walter Hunt](https://walterhunt.com) for introducing me to it and inviting me to attend an in-person draft several year ago.

## octo-waddle-fe

This FE project is a hobby project to learn Elm for building an interactive UI. It is very, very much an early work in progress.
